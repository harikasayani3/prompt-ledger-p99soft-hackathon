## Authentication Flow

1. User registers or logs in → Supabase issues a JWT + refresh token
2. An API key is generated and stored in Supabase (`api_keys` table) with the refresh token
3. The API key is saved to `localStorage` on the client
4. Every tool call sends the API key to the server
5. Server validates the key → exchanges refresh token for a fresh JWT → executes the tool
6. Rotated refresh token is persisted back to the DB

Sessions expire when the Supabase refresh token expires. The app detects this and shows a re-login banner.
